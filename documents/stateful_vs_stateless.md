| **Characteristics**       | **Stateful**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Stateless**                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Definition                | Stateful Protocols require the server to save the state of a process.                                                                                                          | Stateless Protocols do not need the server to save the state of a process.                                                                                                             |
| Response mechanism        | Stateful expects a response and if no answer is received, the request is resent.                                                                                               | In stateless, the client sends a request to a server, which the server responds to based on the state of the request.                                                                  |
| Design complexity         | This makes the design heavy and complex since data needs to be stored.                                                                                                         | Server design is simplified in this case.                                                                                                                                              |
| Requirement of Server     | The server is required to store and save status information and details of sessions.                                                                                           | No server is needed for data storage.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Dependency                | Server and Client are tightly coupled, as in extremely interdependent on each other.                                                                                           | Server and Client are more independent and hence, loosely coupled.                                                                                                                     |
| Transaction Handling      | Transaction handling is relatively slow in the stateful protocol.                                                                                                              | This is relatively faster in the stateless protocol.                                                                                                                                   |
| Implementation            | They are logically heavy to implement.                                                                                                                                         | They are easy to implement.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Functioning after a crash | Since stateful protocols need to store data regarding the sessions, once the crash occurs, all the stored data is lost. Hence, it doesn’t work very well after a crash occurs. | In the event of a crash, stateless protocols work better because there doesn’t exist a state that needs to be restored. A server that failed during the crash can simply be restarted. |
| Design                    | The server design is complex to implement.                                                                                                                                     | The server design is simpler to implement.                                                                                                                                             |
| Working State             | Requests are always dependent on the server-side.                                                                                                                              | Requests are self-contained and not dependent on the server side.                                                                                                                      |
| Userbase                  | These are a thing of the past, and the dynamic user base is very less.                                                                                                         | These are the future because more and more industries are moving towards statelessness.                                                                                                |
| Servers Specifications    | The same server must be utilized to process every request.                                                                                                                     | Different servers can be used to process different information at a time.                                                                                                              |
| Scaling Architecture      | Scaling architecture is difficult and complex.                                                                                                                                 | It is relatively easier to scale architecture.                                                                                                                                         |
| Programming               | It is difficult to code as one of the salient features here is data storage.                                                                                                   | It is much easier to code.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Examples                  | Telnet, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), etc.                                                                                                                                     | HTTP, UDP (User Datagram Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System), etc.                                                                                                                     |
